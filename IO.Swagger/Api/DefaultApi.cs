This API is an ideal pairing with the flight and hotel search to provide ground transportation options at the destination. &lt;p&gt;With this API you can find out the price and type of car, for all car rental providers, in a specified geographical location.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can quickly see the locations of car providers near a given point, and what cars are available to rent, and at what prices. This API is based on our car pricing service that gets live availability from car providers, and is used to power a variety of airline and travel agency websites.&lt;/p&gt;             &lt;p&gt;Results are validated from car providers, and thus response times may take up to 10 seconds (response times are typically about 5s), and the number of concurrent calls is throttled per user to avoid flooding our provider&#39;s systems. However, this means the final result is guaranteed to be live and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The configuration of this API allows search for car rentals in the rental location where the car is picked up (at the start of the rental), is the same as the one where it will be dropped off. &lt;/p&gt;

Amadeus has partnered with &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;http://yapq.io/\&quot;&gt;YapQ&lt;/a&gt; to bring you point of interest APIs with the goal of offering you unbiased ratings of landmarks and tourist attractions. YapQ rates places according to their interest on social media and provides Wikipedia content and Geonames ID at a given location. &lt;br /&gt; YapQ&#39;s service indexes millions of points around the world, and provides content in 12 different languages. This allows you to ensure you catch the &lt;em&gt;must-see&lt;/em&gt; sights at a specific &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;http://yapq.io/cities.html\&quot;&gt;YapQ supported location&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; Each point of interest comes with links to content, grading information, location and directions to help make discovering your destination easy and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This service is still under active development, and the response format may change without warning. We&#39;d be interested in your feedback - &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;mailto:sandbox@yapq.com\&quot;&gt;send us an email&lt;/a&gt;.
